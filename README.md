The Randomizer

The Randomizers is a fun based program that will randomly provide users with one piece of data from a set. A user will be able to input whatever set of data they choose: cat memes, coffee drink of the day, or even icebreakers.  After the data has been input, the Randomzier will allow users to go through the data set and see each piece of the set in a randomized order.

Instead of continually re-writing a program to create different random generators, the Randomizer is a platform that allows any set of data to be inputted. The Randomizer is designed to be versatile and easy to use to ease the process of producing random data programs.
