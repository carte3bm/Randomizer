The Randomizer is a fun-based program that will randomly provide users with one piece of data from a set. A user will be able to input whatever set of data they choose: cat memes, coffee drink of the day, or even icebreakers.  After the data has been input, the Randomzier will allow users to go through the data set and see each piece of the data set in a randomized order.

Instead of continually re-writing a program to create different random generators, the Randomizer is a platform that allows any set of data to be inputted. The Randomizer is designed to be versatile and easy to use to ease the process of producing random data programs.

Scenarios:
Leah is waiting for an appointment to start. She doesn't know anyone in the office and therefore has nobody to talk too. All the magazines in the office are either for people over the age of forty or are about a six months to a year out of date. Instead of staring at the bland paintings on the wall, she pulls out her phone and flips open the Randomizer app. Leah starts flipping through different cat memes and entertains herself until she is called for her appointment.
